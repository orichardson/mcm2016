	\section{Introduction}
	Academic success among undergraduate students at universities in the U.S. depends on several factors, such as teacher capability, class size, and university funding. however, a well-funded institution is more advantaged in providing resources to its students than a university lacking adequate funds. Additional resources that are readily available to the student have been shown to increase student performance across the board.\cite{greenwald1996effect} The Goodgrant Foundation seeks to provide certain institutions with monetary grants with the goal to increase academic success among students at these universities.
