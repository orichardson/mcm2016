	\section{Introduction}
	Academic success among undergraduate students at universities in the U.S. depends on several factors such as teacher capability, class size, and university funding. However, a well-funded institution is more advantaged in providing resources to its students than a university lacking adequate funds. Additional resources that are readily available to the student have been shown to increase student performance across the board.\cite{greenwald1996effect} The Goodgrant Foundation seeks to provide monetary grants to certain institutions with the goal to increase academic success among students at these universities. 
	\\ Perhaps more information here about the paper I cite in the previous paragraph. Student success studies related to fund results <--not really a sentence but ya know
	\\\\
	The Goodgrant Foundation wants its dollars to be allocated in such a way that students benefits are maximized, but to do so in the same manner and focus of other large grant-awarding foundations would be redundant. 
	\\\\
	Thus, we created a model that manages several considerations for the Goodgrant Foundation. 
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item[+] The model ranks all universities according to their current available funds due to outside donations each year in addition to how each university employs those funds. Universities with relatively small donation pools and a loyal history of fund allocation to expansion of student resources receive high rankings.
		\item[+] The model approximates the amount of effective change it can induce by giving funds to schools of various rankings. The schools with optimized rates of changes will receive the largest grants from the Foundation.
		\item[+] The size of grant awarded to each school in the list will be determined by XXXXXXX.
		\item[+] Over a period of five years, the foundation will award each grant according to a predictive distribution of optimal funding per year at each institution. This data comes from published financial data regarding university donation spending.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\section{Assumptions}
	These are some things we assumed in order to create our model!
