	\section{Introduction}
	 Academic success among undergraduate students at universities in the U.S. depends on several factors, such as teacher capability, class size, and university funding. however, a well-funded institution is more advantaged in providing resources to its students than a university lacking adequate funds. Additional resources that are readily available to the student have been shown to increase student performance across the board.\cite{greenwald1996effect} The Goodgrant Foundation seeks to provide certain institutions with monetary grants with the goal to increase academic success among students at these universities. 
	
	
	\section{Assumptions}
	These are some things we assumed in order to create our model!
	
	To do any kind of induction at all, it is necessary to make some commonplace but sometimes very wrong independence assumptions. 
	\section{Model}
	We will assume that each institution uses money in a given way, in a way that has not changed over time. We can represent this as the 
	
	Let $D$ re
		
	\[ \D \to \V \]
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	This is what we conclude after running our model!
	
	\section{Strengths and Weaknesses}
	Here are some good and not so good things about our model!
	
	\section{References}
	Here are all the friendly people who helped us out even if they didn't know they were helping us out!
