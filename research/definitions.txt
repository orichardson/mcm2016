clustering algorithm definitions

vmeasure = validity measure
silhouette coefficient: varies between -1 and 1. measure of distance rations between points in the cluster (i think) pg 541 (pdf pg 55)
randscore: possibly related to random initialization of centroids pg 501 (pdf pg 15)
The Rand index penalizes both false positive and false negative decisions during clustering.
Normalized mutual information can be information-theoretically interpreted.
completeness: a complete cluster assigns every object to a cluster pg 493 (pdf pg 7)
